# Correct way to concatenate strings
print(greet + " " + name)  # 'welcome john'

# Trying .join() in a different way

# More mistakes: trying to use .len() (which doesnâ€™t exist)
# greet.len() or greet.len  -> both will raise AttributeError

# Correct way to get length
print(len(greet))  # 7

# Another mistake: using .lowercase() instead of .lower()
# str_.lowercase()  -> AttributeError

# Fixing it step-by-step
str_ = str_.strip()
print(str_)  # 'HELLO WORLD'

# More string mistakes with quotes
# txt = "hello you can use "print" command"  -> SyntaxError

# Fixing quotes with escape characters
txt = "hello \"john\" welcome"
print(txt)  # 'hello "john" welcome'

# Trying raw strings
# txt = r"hi everyone i am "john"" -> This would still fail due to quote mismatch

# Proper raw string example
txt = r"hello world\nhow are you"
print(txt)  # Output: hello world\nhow are you (no newline because it's raw)

# Working with file paths (Windows style)
path = "c:\mnt\c"  # might give warning because \m is not a valid escape

# Better to use raw strings for paths
path = r"c:\mnt\c"
print(path)  # 'c:\mnt\c'

# Or escape backslashes manually
path = "c:\\mnt\\c"
print(path)  # 'c:\mnt\c'

# Ending backslash still works with escapes
path = "c:\\mnt\\c\\"
print(path)  # 'c:\mnt\c\'
